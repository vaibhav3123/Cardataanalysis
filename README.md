# ðŸš— Car Price Analysis  

ðŸ“Œ Overview 

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the key factors influencing **car prices and resale value**. By analyzing various attributes such as **car model, mileage, engine size, owner history, and fuel type**, we uncover trends that help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.  

The analysis was conducted using **Python**, leveraging **Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**, with a strong emphasis on **data cleaning, transformation, and visualization**.  

## Dataset  
The dataset includes information on various used cars, covering:  
- **Car Model & Year**  
- **Price & Depreciation Trends**  
- **Mileage & Engine Size**  
- **Owner History**  
- **Fuel Type & Transmission**  

## Key Insights  
- **Car Model & Year Impact**  
  - Newer cars (2011-2017) generally have **higher resale value**.  
  - **Price depreciation is steep after 5-7 years**.  
- **Mileage & Price Relationship**  
  - Higher mileage (150,000+ km) leads to **lower resale prices**.  
  - Cars with **less than 100,000 km retain more value**.  
- **Engine Size & Fuel Type**  
  - Larger engines (2.0L - 4.0L) **increase car prices**.  
  - **Diesel cars** are generally **cheaper** than petrol cars of the same model.  
- **Owner Count & Resale Value**  
  - Cars with **1-2 owners** tend to **sell for higher prices**.  
  - **4+ owners significantly reduce resale value**.  
- **Popular Brands & Price Trends**  
  - Brands like **Toyota, BMW, and Mercedes** retain value better.  

## Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**:  
  - Handled missing values  
  - Encoded categorical variables  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Grouping, aggregating, and analyzing key trends  
  - Identified correlations and statistical summaries  
- **Data Visualization**:  
  - Created **insightful graphs** to effectively communicate findings  

## Conclusion  
This analysis reveals that **newer cars, lower mileage, and fewer owners** retain higher resale value, while **older models, high mileage, and multiple owners** decrease prices. These insights help buyers make informed decisions and enable sellers to price their vehicles competitively.
